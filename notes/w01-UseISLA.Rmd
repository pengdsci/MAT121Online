**ISLA** (*Interactive Statistics Learning Applications*) is a set of interactive apps created by the instructor to facilitate your learning in this class.  

\

<center><font color = "navy" size = 3>**Goals of ISLA Apps**</font></center>

\

The goals of creating these apps are outlined in the following

* **Making Stats Concepts Intuitive**

Although most of the concepts and procedures are not abstract, some pf them such as sampling distributions involving limiting processes are not intuitive and can even be surprising for beginners. A few **ISLA apps** have used simulations to provide some degree of intuition for these ideas.

* **Reproducing Steps of Procedures**

Most descriptive and inferential procedures are structured. The majority of **ISLA apps** can reproduce the steps involved in these procedures once you grasp the related basic concepts. These steps were described in detail in the lecture notes for the corresponding modules.


* **Generating Solutions**

Due to the structured nature of most procedures, many **ISLA apps** can provide solutions to problems in this class. All you need to do is check the given information, select the appropriate **ISLA app**, and enter the provided details into the input box to generate the solution.

\

<center><font color = "navy" size = 3>**Use ISLA Responsibly**</font></center>

\

Although most **ISLA apps** can generate solutions to many descriptive and inferential statistics problems, they are **not** designed for completing assignments without a clear understanding of the underlying concepts and procedures. Instead, they are meant to:

* **Make certain concepts more intuitive**;

* **Streamline the structure of your solutions** by following a logical reasoning flow;

* **Validate worked examples** from notes or other resources when you rework them;

* **Check your work** while practicing problems.

<font color = "darkred">**An Important Note:** All **ISLA apps** will be disabled during the final exam, scheduled for Sunday, June 29, 2025, from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM.</font>
